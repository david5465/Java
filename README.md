This is the first way i found to capture my screen I'm newbie with Java so there are lot to thigs to improve and did this more as a practice. 

TODO I need  to convert all the png files to a mp4 or AVI file

I'm working on that

1. First step I  did its to import the necessary libraries then declare variables

2. On main Method I first start the audio record then create the folder output for the files if its not created yet

3. On a While loop take screenshots while record the audio and save it as a .wav

4. Finally the break sentence to stop the record.
