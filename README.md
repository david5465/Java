This is the first way i found to capture my screen I'm newbie with Java so there are lot to thigs to improve and did this more as a practice. 
TODO I need  to convert all the png files to a mp4 or AVI file
I'm working on that
First its to import the necessary libraries then declare variables
On main Method i first start the audio record then create the folder output for the files if its not created yet
On a While loop take screenshots while record the audio and save it as a .wav
Finally the break sentence to stop the record.
